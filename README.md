Sample api for Money Transfer (assignment)
Hello Dear friends

many thanks for reviewing my assignment

Assignment:
Mr. Robert wants to transfer X amount to a beneficiary.

Once transfer is created, it gets added to transfer cart. User can sign any transfer from transfer cart using the signing code. Once a transfer is signed, it will become a transaction.

 

Build an API that allows user to perform following actions:

- Create transfer to cart

- Get transfers from cart

- Sign transfer

- Get transactions

 

For data in memory database/store can be used.

 

Bonus:

- API should be documented, so it's clear which endpoints are existing and how to use them.

- Validations should be added wherever applicable.
